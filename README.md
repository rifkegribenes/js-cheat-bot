# js-cheat-bot

## Project description

**What is JS Cheat Bot?**  
* A Q & A bot that can answer Javascript-related questions.   
* It suggests MDN or StackOverflow resources to answer questions.   
* Eventually it will become an AI bot that will learn patterns from users and answers will be more accurate.  
* Users will be able to vote for the best answers. Rather than searching Google, we will ask this bot.   
* This will be more specific than Google to deliver answers to Javascript-specific questions.
